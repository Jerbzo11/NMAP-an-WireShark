VULNERABILITY SCANNING:
Nmap is not primarily a vulnerability scanner like tools such as OpenVAS or Nessus, but it does include a powerful scripting engine (Nmap Scripting Engine, or NSE) that can be used to detect vulnerabilities. Below are Nmap commands and scripts related to vulnerability detection:
1. Vulnerability Scanning with NSE Scripts

    nmap --script vuln <target>: Run all vulnerability detection scripts against the target. This is the easiest way to scan for known vulnerabilities.
    nmap --script <script-name> <target>: Run a specific vulnerability script against the target. For example, nmap --script http-vuln-cve2017-5638 <target> scans for Apache Struts2 vulnerability (CVE-2017-5638).

2. Common Vulnerability Detection Scripts

Here are some commonly used NSE scripts for vulnerability detection:

    nmap --script http-vuln-cve2017-5638 <target>: Detects Apache Struts2 vulnerability (CVE-2017-5638).

FIREWALL:
Nmap includes various techniques and commands to detect and bypass firewalls, IDS (Intrusion Detection Systems), and IPS (Intrusion Prevention Systems). Below is a list of Nmap commands and techniques related to firewalls:
1. Firewall Evasion and Spoofing

    nmap -D <decoy1>,<decoy2>,... <target>: Use decoys to hide the real source of the scan. This sends packets from multiple addresses (real and decoy) to confuse the firewall or IDS.
    nmap -S <spoofed_IP> <target>: Spoof the source IP address. This can be useful for bypassing simple IP-based firewalls, though it might not receive responses.
    nmap --source-port <port_number> <target>: Specify a source port. Some firewalls allow traffic from certain ports (like 80 for HTTP), so spoofing the source port might bypass them.
    nmap --data-length <size> <target>: Append random data to packets to evade IDS/IPS systems that use pattern matching.
    nmap -f <target>: Fragment packets into smaller pieces. This can help evade some firewalls or IDS that don't properly reassemble fragmented packets.
    nmap --mtu <value> <target>: Set a custom MTU (Maximum Transmission Unit) to fragment packets at a specific size, potentially bypassing firewalls.
    nmap --ttl <value> <target>: Set the TTL (Time To Live) value of packets. Some IDS/IPS or firewalls may be configured to drop packets with unusual TTL values.

2. Stealth Scanning Techniques

    nmap -sS <target>: TCP SYN scan (also known as a stealth scan). It sends a SYN packet and waits for a response without completing the TCP handshake, making it less detectable.
    nmap -sF <target>: TCP FIN scan. It sends a FIN packet to the target, which may bypass certain firewalls.
    nmap -sX <target>: TCP Xmas scan. This scan sends a packet with FIN, PSH, and URG flags set, which may evade some firewalls.
    nmap -sN <target>: TCP Null scan. It sends a packet with no flags set, which might bypass certain firewalls that focus on detecting SYN packets.
    nmap -sA <target>: TCP ACK scan. Used to map out firewall rulesets, ACK scans are useful for determining if a firewall is stateful.

3. Firewalking

    nmap --traceroute <target>: Perform a traceroute to see the path packets take through the network, which can help identify firewalls and routers.
    nmap --reason <target>: Shows the reason why a port is reported as open, closed, or filtered, providing insight into firewall behavior.

4. Firewall Detection

    nmap -sA <target>: ACK scan. This technique is used to map out firewall rulesets and determine if a firewall is stateful. If a firewall is present, it will block the packet, and the port will appear filtered.
    nmap -sW <target>: TCP Window scan. Similar to the ACK scan but uses TCP window size to differentiate between open and closed ports, potentially revealing firewall configurations.
    nmap --badsum <target>: Send packets with a bogus TCP/UDP checksum to see how the firewall responds. Some firewalls pass these packets through, which can indicate its presence.

5. Timing Options

    nmap -T0: Paranoid scan, sending one packet at a time with long delays. Useful for evading highly sensitive IDS/IPS.
    nmap -T1: Sneaky scan, slightly faster than Paranoid mode, still effective at avoiding detection.
    nmap -T2: Polite scan, reduces network load and increases the chance of remaining undetected.
    nmap -T3: Normal scan, the default setting, balances speed and stealth.
    nmap -T4: Aggressive scan, speeds up the scan but increases the likelihood of detection.
    nmap -T5: Insane scan, very fast, but highly detectable.

6. Bypassing Firewalls with Idle Scanning

    nmap -sI <zombie_IP> <target>: Idle scan using a "zombie" host. This is a highly stealthy scan that uses another host to send packets, making it very difficult for the target to detect the true source of the scan.

7. Probing Firewalls

    nmap -p 80 --source-port 53 <target>: Probes a specific port (e.g., 80) using a common source port (e.g., 53 for DNS) to check if the firewall allows traffic from that source.
    nmap -sA --reason <target>: ACK scan with reason flags to understand how the firewall handles packets and why certain responses are returned.

8. Analysis of Firewall Rules

    nmap --packet-trace <target>: Show all packets sent and received, allowing detailed analysis of how the firewall is handling or blocking certain packets.
    nmap --badsum <target>: Send packets with bad checksums to see how the firewall responds; some firewalls might pass these packets, revealing weaknesses.

9. Bypassing Application-Layer Firewalls

    nmap --script http-method-tamper <target>: Attempts to bypass application-layer firewalls by tampering with HTTP methods.

10. Miscellaneous

    nmap --spoof-mac <mac address>: Spoof your MAC address to disguise your scan.
    nmap --proxies <url1>,<url2>,... <target>: Scan through a chain of HTTP/SOCKS4 proxies to obfuscate the source of the scan.

11. Advanced Evasion Techniques

    nmap --scan-delay <time> <target>: Introduce a delay between probes to avoid triggering rate-limiting firewalls.
    nmap --max-retries <number> <target>: Limit the number of retries for sending probes, useful for bypassing firewalls that drop packets sporadically.
    nmap --randomize-hosts <target>: Randomize the order in which hosts are scanned to evade firewalls and IDS that track sequential scans.

12. Analysis of Firewalled Hosts

    nmap -p <port> --open <target>: Focus on open ports, ignoring filtered or closed ports to streamline the scan results when a firewall blocks certain ports.

13. Service Detection Behind Firewalls

    nmap -sV --version-intensity 9 <target>: Increase version detection intensity to try to identify services that are protected by a firewall.

These commands and techniques provide a powerful set of tools to detect, analyze, and evade firewalls, IDS, and IPS systems, allowing you to map out network defenses and probe for potential weaknesses.

    nmap -p 21,22,23,80,443,554,8000,8080 <target>: Scan for a broader range of ports that might be open on CCTV devices, including FTP (21), SSH (22), and HTTPS (443).
    nmap --script http-fileupload-exploiter <target>: Test for insecure file upload functionalities, which could allow an attacker to upload malicious files to the CCTV system.

10. Firmware Backdoor Detection

    nmap --script smb-vuln-ms17-010 <target>: Although not directly related to CCTV, this can check if the DVR/NVR has an SMB vulnerability that could lead to a backdoor or ransomware attack.
    nmap --script cctv-dvr-backdoor <target>: A custom script that checks for backdoors in specific CCTV DVRs.

11. Capturing Video Feeds

    nmap --script=rtsp-url-brute <target>: Bruteforce RTSP URLs to capture video feeds from cameras.

12. Monitoring and Analysis

    nmap --script=snmp-info <target>: Retrieve SNMP information, if available, from CCTV systems that could provide insights into the network configuration and status of the devices.

13. CCTV-Specific Scans

    nmap -p80 --script http-methods <target>: Identifies HTTP methods enabled on CCTV devices, which could indicate weak points for attack.
    nmap --script telnet-ntlm-info <target>: Gathers NTLM authentication information via Telnet, which could be useful for further exploits.

These commands help you discover, interact with, and potentially exploit vulnerabilities in CCTV systems, but it's important to use them ethically and legally, especially since CCTV systems are often used for security purposes. Unauthorized access to CCTV systems is illegal and unethical. Always have explicit permission before conducting any scans or tests on these systems.








CIGNAL COMMAND:
If you're referring to "Cignal," it could be related to Cignal TV, a satellite television service in the Philippines, or a general term for signaling and communication technologies. However, based on common usage and the context of network tools, I'll focus on general network scanning commands related to detecting signaling or communication services that might be relevant.
